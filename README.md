👋 Hi there! I'm Venigalla Sai Bharath, a passionate software developer specializing in modern web technologies.

💼 Currently, I'm an integral part of the SaaS team in Bungee tech as an SDE-1, where I design and build interactive dashboards for diverse KPIs and create sophisticated workflow web tools.

🚀 With a strong command of React.js, Node.js, and Express.js, I thrive in building dynamic and user-friendly web applications. My proficiency extends to database management, where I wield PostgreSQL to create robust and efficient data solutions.

🌐 As a firm believer in delivering top-notch performance, I've honed my deployment skills using AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk and AWS Lambda. This enables me to provide seamless, scalable, and serverless experiences for users.

📚 Constantly learning and staying up-to-date with industry trends, I'm dedicated to refining my expertise and embracing new challenges in the ever-evolving world of software development.

🛠️ My toolkit includes ReactJS, Node js, and Express, combined with Python and PostgreSQL. I'm well-versed in harnessing AWS services such as S3, EC2, Lambda, Secret Manager, Dynamo DB, Code Pipeline, and Cognito for seamless data storage, deployment and running web tools, and user authentication.
